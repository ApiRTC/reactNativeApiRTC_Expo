# ReactNativeApiRTC with Expo

Demo for usage of apiRTC.js on React Native using the Expo framework.

ApiRTC is full WebRTC API SDK provided by Apizee: https://apirtc.com/

This demo is also using react-native-webrtc: https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc

Another demo on react native without any framework usage is available here : https://github.com/ApiRTC/reactNativeApiRTC

# Welcome to your ApiRTC Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set up your environment

  Complete informations to start can be found on this page :
    - [Set up](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build&buildEnv=local)

  We advice to start the application locally on your phone connected to your computer

  <b>IOS :</b>
  
   ```bash
        npx expo prebuild --clean
   ```
          -> this will apply all needed configuration on your projet using our plugin [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apirtc/expo-apirtc-options-plugin](expo-apirtc-options-plugin)
   ```bash
        npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

  <b>Android :</b>

   ```bash
        npx expo run:android
   ```

  And then scan the bar code to start the application

**_Note For iOS :_**
  - replace "YOUR_TEAM_ID" with your apple development team identifier in app.json
  in ios section :
   ```bash  
      "appleTeamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
   ```

  and in plugin section :
   ```bash
      ["@apirtc/expo-apirtc-options-plugin",
      {
        "enableMediaProjectionService": true,
        "appleTeamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
      }]
   ```

   Don't forget to reset your project with :

   ```bash
        npx expo prebuild --clean
   ```

## FAQ

### Requirements
* React Native needs Node.js >= 16 (Check [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if needed)

### Restrictions
* iOS screenSharing : screenSharing stream cannot be displayed locally on the application on iOS

### What are the packages that are needed in the application :

- [@apirtc/react-native-apirtc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apirtc/apirtc)
Our apiRTC librairie that is used to integrate WebRTC and communicate with our servers
- [react-native-webrtc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-webrtc)
Used to add webRTC support in the application
- [@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc) :
This will add needed autorisation in your app (access to microphone/camera)
- [react-native-device-info](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-device-info)
Used to get device information on React Native
- [socket.io-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-client)
Used to manage the connexion with our server (Websocket, HTTP polling)
- [expo-apirtc-options-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apirtc/expo-apirtc-options-plugin)
Used to manage native interaction for feature like screensharing

You will find all the details in our package.json.

### What are the authorizations that are needed to be declared on application

In app.json, make sure to add :

    "plugins": [
      ["@config-plugins/react-native-webrtc"],
      //...
    ],

This will tell Expo to include the webrtc config plugin in the prebuild process.

### How to activate blur on camera stream on iOS :

To activate Blur on video stream, it is possible to use the iOS portrait effect feature on the application :
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-video-conferencing-features-iphaa0b5671d/ios

To activate, you will have to modify app.json by adding '"UIBackgroundModes": ["voip"]' or '"NSCameraPortraitEffectEnabled" : true' parameters 

    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "UIBackgroundModes": ["voip"],
        [...]
      }
    },

or 

    "ios": {
      "infoPlist": {
        "NSCameraPortraitEffectEnabled" : true,
        [...]
      }
    },

More information here : https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10047/?time=1324.
Voip parameter will also activate studio light and reactions feature.

## Tips for development

### Android SDK

Make sure that you have set ANDROID_HOME value

Sample for mac :
nano ~/.bash_profile
add following lines in bash_profile file:

    export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Android/sdk/  //Path to your Android SDK

    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

source ~/.bash_profile //To apply modifications

echo $ANDROID_HOME //To check modifications

### Which node version was used for tutorial testings

NodeJs version 20.5.1 . (Check [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you need to have several nodeJs version)

### Deactivation of Fast refresh

Fast refresh will give unwanted behavior with apiRTC, as it will create an new UserAgent and a new Session : we advice you to deactivate Fast Refresh on developper menu.

Once the app is open again, shake your device to reveal the developer menu. If you are using an emulator, press Ctrl + M for Android or Cmd âŒ˜ + D for iOS.

If you see Enable Fast Refresh, press it. If you see Disable Fast Refresh, dismiss the developer menu. Now try making another change.
